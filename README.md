# qPCR-auto

A web app to handle processing of raw qPCR data - providing experimental   timeline tracking, data analysis (pandas, polars, janitor, NumPy), and visulization (Seaborn, Plotly) alongside insights on data quality. This serves to streamline longitudinal lab-specific experiments using qPCR, standardize processing procedures, and assay quality of data to ensure reproducibility and quality.
