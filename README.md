# qPCR-auto

A Python/Javascript web app designed to streamline longitudinal, lab-specific experiments measuring quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data. The goal of this app is to standardize data processing and visualization; assay and rank experiment quality; and provide timeline tracking.

## Features

- Scalable and efficient server API using Flask (Python 3.8)
- Responsive user experience with Vanilla JS & Chart.js (ES6)
- Sleek and modern design & styling with Tailwind CSS (3.0) and Flowbite
- Seamless cloud integration with Google Cloud

## Purpose and used libraries
- Mass analysis of raw qPCR data for statistical and visual insights
- Utilizes powerful libraries like Pandas, Polars, Pyjanitor, NumPy, Chart.js, and Seaborn
- Records experimental history to aid scientific decision-making
- Functional alerts for maintaining experimental quality
